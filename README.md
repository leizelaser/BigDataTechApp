# Big Data --- Technology and Applications
Materials collected in markdown format, used as the lecture notes for the course: Big Data --- Technology and Applications in the [School of Statistics](http://tongji.xaufe.edu.cn/), [Xi'an University of Finance and Economy](http://www.xaufe.edu.cn/).

# Table of Contents:

* Prerequested installation of system and software
  Note that we don't need to install all the softwares at the same time: we may only install what we need, and the softwares have little mutual dependence.
* Brief introduction/review of Python programming
  We suggest Anaconda as the package manager.
* Brief introduction/review of C/C++ programming
  We suggest gcc/g++ as the compiler. It would be fine that one uses Visual Studio for Windows.
* Brief introduction/review of database
  We would review the basic format of dataset, and the names of popular software used for statistics.
  We would primarily use pandas, a package in Python to treat the data.
* Brief introduction to MPI
  Basic programs for a distributed system, mpich as the compiler.
* Brief introduction to OpenMP
  Basic Programs for parallel computation, OpenMP package needed.
* Hadoop
  Popular open-source scalable, distributed computing software platform.
* Spark
  Integrated on Hadoop, designed for complexer situations.
